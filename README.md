Missing person finder with yolo algorithm and also track the person with the cameras


## Abstract

Tracing a missing person is too difficult to undertake today. Despite the fact that social media keeps us all
informed, it is consuming more time and also procedure that involves many pieces of paper. Furthermore, there
aren&#39;t many prospects for success after all of this effort. Through the use of face recognition, this project provides a
system that benefits both the public and the police department. As a result, this method functions by allowing the
guardian of the missing person to upload the image, which is subsequently saved in our database.Our system&#39;s facial
recognition model will then utilize the YOLO approach to search the database for a match for that person.A
notification will be sent in the application if a match is discovered. Finding the missing individual is the biggest
advantage of any facial recognition system, which may be utilized for a variety of purposes. To make the process of
discovering the missing person easier, we want to develop an application that will be utilised by a few volunteers
and will allow us to locate the missing person swiftly. This will allow us to establish whether the missing person
depicted in an image taken from a certain location is correct.. If it is, police can then take the appropriate next steps
to locate the person from that location.
